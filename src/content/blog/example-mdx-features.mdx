# Welcome to the Blog

This is an example post showing the features available for writing.

## Basic Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and ***bold italic*** together.

You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ for deleted content.

> This is a blockquote. Great for highlighting quotes or important notes.
> It can span multiple lines.

## Code Blocks

Inline code looks like `const x = 42` within text.

For larger code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
// TypeScript example
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

function greet(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}
```

```python
# Python example
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    fib = [0, 1]
    for _ in range(2, n):
        fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])
    return fib[:n]
```

## Lists

Unordered lists:

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

Ordered lists:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
